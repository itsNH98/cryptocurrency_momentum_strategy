# Liu (2021) - Risks and Returns of Cryptocurrency 

"We next turn to examine the relationship between the coin market returns and the main cryptocurrency-specific factors that are proposed in the theoritical literature"

Factors: 
1. Network Factors
2. Production factors 
3. Cryptocurrency momentum 
4. Average and negative investor attention 
5. Cryptocurrency valuation ratios

Network factors:
- Coin market returns positively and significantly exposed to cryptocurrency network growth 

Production factors: 
- Cost of mining (electricity and computer power)
- Not significantly exposed to the cryptocurrency production factors 

Valuation ratios:
- Do not affect the cryptocurrency prices
- None of any proxies are useful in valuing cryptocurrencies 

Other asset classes: 
- Little evidence behind the narrative that there are similarities between cryptocurrencies and these traditional asset (gold, fiat, etc )

Summary: Seems like the most important components of cryptocurrency valuation are : Momentum, Investor Attention and Size


## Our two Indicators: Momentum and Investor Attention

**Momentum**
Description:
- Strongly predict future cryptocurrency cumulative returns 
- Significant time series momentum in cryptocurrency market 
- "Grouping weekly returns by terciles, we find that the top terciles outperform the bottom terciles over the one to four weeks horizons"
- Don't think the analysis is based on specific cryptocurrencies but rather on the whole index 

Methodology:
- Using Price returns at various estimation windows and various holding period (add modularity)
- Very similar to Traditional Momentum 

**Investor Attention**
Description:
- Strongly predict future cryptocurrency cumulative returns 
- Proxied with Google Searches 
- High investor attention predicts high future returns over the one to six week horizon 
- One standard deviation increase in investor attention measure yields a 3.0% increase in the 1-week-ahead future coin market returns
- Similar results for Twitter Measures 
- Also proxying for negative investor attention 

Methodology:
- Constructing the deviation of Google searches for the word Bitcoin in a given week compared with the average of those in the preceding four week 
- Standardization of the measure to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one 

**Negative Investor Attention** 
- Ratio between Google Searches for "Bitcoin Hack" and "Bitcoin" 


"Google Search measures do not significantly correlate with past coin market returns beyond one week. Intuitively, these results suggest that investor attention is elevated after superior cryptocurrency performance."

"The interaction term is not significant at any of the eight horizons, suggesting that the magnitudeof the time-series momentum effect is similar for high and low investorattention periods"

Cross Sectional Analysis:
- Grouping the cryptos in two groups: High and Low attention
- The timeseries momentum effect is stronger for the relatively low-attention coins (??)
- Consistent with the “underreaction” mechanism of momentum.

Won't be too difficult to test empirically

# Liu (2022) - Common Risk Factors in Cryptocurrency 

Three factors: Market, size and momentum, capture the cross-sectional expected cryptocurrency returns

Considering all coins with market capitalization of above 1 Million dollars 

Importance:
1. Empirical regularities that can be used as stylized factors to assess and develop theoritical models
2. Understand the difference with traditional asset pricing 

Market, size and momentum capture most of the cross-sectional expected returns 

Adjusted for the cryptocurrency three-factor model, none of the alphas of the 10 strategies remains statistically significant

**Plausible mechanisms**
Size:
- Liquidity view of the size premium 
- Not a very good idea to trade illiquidity

Momentum:
- Momentum effect is markedly stronger among the large and well-known coin 

"Consistent with these theories, we further find that (i) the cryptocurrency mo-mentum effect is more pronounced among coins that receive high investor at-tention, and (ii) the momentum factor is stronger at times of high investor at-tention."

"We thus analyze each strategy that shorts Bitcoin instead of shorting the relevant quintile portfolio. The results are almost unchanged."

"We next focus on the 20 largest and most liquid cryptocurrencies and test the trading strate-gies. We show that using the top 20 coins yields qualitatively similar results."

## Core (Momentum)

Based on past one, two, three, four, eight, 16, 50, 100 week returns 

All strategies are rebalanced weekly

1-4 weeks strategies 

"The differences in the average returns of the highest and lowest quintiles are 2.5% for the one-week momentum strategy, 3.1% for the two-week momentums trategy, 3.1% for the three-week momentum strategy, 2.2% for the four-week momentum strategy, and 1.7% for the one-to-four-week momentum strategy."


Size will proxy for illiquidity premium, but that doesn't help us a trading perspective


"We find that the cryptocurrency momentum effect is plausibly consistent with the investor overreaction mechanism. After the initial continuation, there isa long-horizon reversal effect. Moreover, we find that the cryptocurrency mo-mentum effect is markedly stronger among the large and well-known coins.These findings are in line with the attention-based overreaction-induced momentum effect (Peng and Xiong (2006), Andrei and Hasler (2015)). Consistent with these theories, we further show that the cryptocurrency momentum effect is more pronounced among coins that receive high investor attention and
at times of high investor attention.

Pronounced momentum effect among coins that receive high investor attention and at times of high investor attention 

## Detailed Investigation 

**Momentum and Size**

Looking at the longer term horizons, we see that momentum disappears and turns into Reversals 

"We find that the long-short momentum strategy in the below-median size group generates insignificant weekly returns. In contrast, the long-short momen-tum strategy in the above-median size group generates statistically signifi-cant 3.2% weekly returns." (!!!!)

Long-Short Momentum strategy works better than the larger coins 

**Momentum and Attention**
"Consistent with the hypothesis, the momentum effect is more pronounced among coins with high attention as proxied by trading volume."

"Consistent with the hypothesis, the momentum effect is more pronounced among coins with high attention as proxied by Google searches."

Momentum Should also be stronger at time of high investor attention

Using the word: "cryptocurrency"

"For the momentum strategies, the average long-shortstrategy returns are highly statistically significant. The sizes of the premia arelarger than those of the baseline results, consistent with the findings abovethat cryptocurrency momentum effects are stronger among large coins"
